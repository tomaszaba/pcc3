The anonymous surveys measured acute malnutrition and mortality employing the SMART methodology in
the Nuba mountains of western and central regions of South Kordofan. Each location had two separate surveys
targeting two different population groups (i.e., IDPs and residents). Surveys in the western region on IDPs included
IDP sites in Dilling, Habila and Al Lagowa county, and another survey on the population living outside the IDP
sites (residents) in Dilling, Habila, Al Lagowa and As Sunut. Similarly, in surveys in central regions on IDPs included
IDP sites in Delami, Western Kadugli and Um Durein counties, whilst those on the residents, included population
across Delami, Talawdi, Western Kadugli, Um Durein, Heiban and Al Buram (Thobo).
